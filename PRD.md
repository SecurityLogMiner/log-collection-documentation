## Problem Statement

Gathering data from arbitrary log sources should not be a time-consuming task.
Blueteams, network admins, and anyone wanting to record and store the events 
of a service should have an efficient, secure method of doing so.

---

## Goals and Objectives

A stream of log events, provided by the client endpoint, will be packaged and
transported to a central cloud server for storage and retrieval. 

Whether on a windows or \*Nix-based endpoint, a user will be able to create an
account, receive proper credentials, and establish a secure connection between
the source of their logs and the central data-storage server.

Compatibility with ElasticSearch should be available to the user that will
complement the service the central storage server provides.
